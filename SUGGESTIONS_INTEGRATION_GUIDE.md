## 🔧 **INTEGRATION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Add Suggestions to Main Bot Menu**

Add this to your main bot menu/keyboard:

```python
# In your main menu function
keyboard = [
    [
        InlineKeyboardButton("💡 Suggestions", callback_data="suggestions_menu"),
        # ... other buttons
    ]
]
```

### **Step 2: Register Suggestion Handlers**

Add this to your `bot.py` or main application file:

```python
from commands.suggestion_commands import get_suggestion_handlers

# In your bot setup
def setup_handlers(application):
    # ... existing handlers
    
    # Add suggestion handlers
    suggestion_handlers = get_suggestion_handlers()
    for handler in suggestion_handlers:
        application.add_handler(handler)
```

### **Step 3: Add Suggestions Menu Callback**

Add this to your main callback handler:

```python
async def handle_main_callback(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    query = update.callback_query
    
    if query.data == "suggestions_menu":
        from commands.suggestion_commands import show_suggestions_menu
        await show_suggestions_menu(update, context)
    # ... other callbacks
```

## 🚨 **WORKER BAN FIX**

I also created `fix_worker_ban.py` to address the Worker 4 ban issue you mentioned. Run this script to clear the ban:

```bash
python3 fix_worker_ban.py
```

This will clear all active bans for Worker 4 and get it back to work.
