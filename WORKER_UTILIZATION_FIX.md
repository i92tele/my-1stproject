# AutoFarming Bot Worker Utilization Fix

## Problem Summary

The AutoFarming Bot was only using 2 workers for posting despite having 10 workers initialized. This led to inefficient posting and many due ads being left unposted.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Slot-Level Worker Assignment**: The original code assigned one worker per ad slot, not per destination. This meant that if there were only 2 due ad slots, only 2 workers would be used regardless of how many destinations each slot had.

2. **Inefficient Destination Distribution**: Each slot's destinations were processed sequentially by a single worker, even if other workers were idle.

3. **Potential Database Issues**: Some workers might not be properly initialized in the database, or usage counters might be incorrectly showing them as at their limits.

4. **Timestamp Update Issues**: The code was updating timestamps prematurely, which could mark slots as posted even if only some destinations were processed.

## Solution Implemented

The solution involved several key changes to optimize worker utilization:

### 1. Destination-Level Worker Distribution

The posting logic was modified to distribute destinations across all available workers instead of assigning one worker per slot. This ensures maximum worker utilization.

```python
# Distribute destinations across multiple workers for maximum efficiency
for i, destination in enumerate(slot_dests):
    # Find next available worker
    worker_assigned = False
    attempts = 0
    max_attempts = len(available_workers) * 2  # Try twice through all workers
    
    while not worker_assigned and attempts < max_attempts:
        worker_data = available_workers[worker_index % len(available_workers)]
        worker_id = int(worker_data['worker_id'])
        worker = self._get_worker_by_id(worker_id)
        worker_index += 1
        attempts += 1
        
        if worker:
            # Check if this worker is under limit
            under_limit, usage_info = await self._is_worker_under_limit(worker_id)
            if under_limit:
                # Create posting task for this destination with this worker
                task = self._post_single_destination_parallel(ad_slot, destination, worker, results, posted_slots)
                posting_tasks.append(task)
                logger.info(f"üìù Created task: Worker {worker_id} -> Slot {slot_id} -> {destination.get('destination_name', 'Unknown')}")
                worker_assigned = True
            else:
                logger.debug(f"Worker {worker_id} at limit, trying next worker")
        else:
            logger.warning(f"Worker {worker_id} not found, trying next worker")
```

### 2. Single Destination Posting Method

A new method `_post_single_destination_parallel` was created to handle posting a single destination with a specific worker, allowing for better distribution and parallelization.

```python
async def _post_single_destination_parallel(self, ad_slot: Dict, destination: Dict, worker, results: Dict[str, Any], posted_slots: set = None):
    """Post a single ad slot to a single destination using the assigned worker."""
    slot_id = ad_slot.get('id')
    slot_type = ad_slot.get('slot_type', 'user')
    
    try:
        # Post the ad
        success = await self._post_single_ad(ad_slot, destination, worker)
        
        if success:
            results['successful_posts'] += 1
            logger.info(f"‚úÖ Worker {worker.worker_id} successfully posted slot {slot_id} to {destination.get('destination_name', 'Unknown')}")
            
            # Record usage
            try:
                await self.database.record_worker_post(worker.worker_id, destination.get('destination_id'))
            except Exception as rec_err:
                logger.warning(f"Failed to record worker usage: {rec_err}")
            
            # Update last_sent_at for the slot (only once per slot, not per destination)
            if posted_slots is not None and slot_id not in posted_slots:
                posted_slots.add(slot_id)
                await self._mark_slot_as_posted(slot_id, slot_type)
            
        else:
            results['failed_posts'] += 1
            logger.warning(f"‚ùå Worker {worker.worker_id} failed to post slot {slot_id} to {destination.get('destination_name', 'Unknown')}")
        
        # Anti-ban delay between posts
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        
    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Error posting slot {slot_id} to destination {destination.get('destination_id')}: {e}"
        logger.error(error_msg)
        results['errors'].append(error_msg)
        results['failed_posts'] += 1
```

### 3. Thread-Safe Timestamp Updates

A dedicated method for updating timestamps was implemented to ensure slots are only marked as posted once, even when multiple workers are posting to different destinations of the same slot.

```python
async def _mark_slot_as_posted(self, slot_id: int, slot_type: str):
    """Mark a slot as posted (update last_sent_at) - thread-safe version."""
    try:
        success = await self.database.update_slot_last_sent(slot_id, slot_type)
        if success:
            logger.info(f"‚úÖ Updated last_sent_at for slot {slot_id}")
        else:
            logger.error(f"‚ùå Failed to update last_sent_at for slot {slot_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed updating last_sent_at for slot {slot_id}: {e}")
```

### 4. Proper Anti-Ban Delays

The code now includes a proper 3-second delay between posts to avoid triggering anti-spam measures.

```python
# Anti-ban delay between posts
await asyncio.sleep(3)
```

### 5. Posted Slots Tracking

A `posted_slots` set was added to track which slots have already been marked as posted, preventing duplicate timestamp updates.

```python
# Track which slots have been marked as posted to avoid duplicate updates
posted_slots = set()
```

## Diagnostic and Fix Scripts

Three scripts were created to help diagnose and fix the issues:

1. **test_worker_utilization.py**: Tests the optimized posting logic to verify that all workers are being utilized.

2. **check_due_ads.py**: Checks why `get_active_ads_to_send()` might not be returning all due ads.

3. **fix_worker_utilization.py**: Applies fixes to ensure all workers are properly initialized and all slots are due for posting.

## Expected Results

With these changes, the AutoFarming Bot should now:

1. **Utilize All 10 Workers**: All available workers will be used for posting, distributing the workload evenly.

2. **Process All Due Ads**: Every ad that is due for posting will be processed.

3. **Respect Anti-Ban Rules**: Proper delays between posts will help avoid triggering anti-spam measures.

4. **Prevent Duplicate Updates**: Slots will only be marked as posted once, even when multiple workers are posting to different destinations of the same slot.

## Verification

To verify that the fix is working correctly:

1. Run `python fix_worker_utilization.py` to ensure all workers are properly initialized and slots are due.

2. Run `python test_worker_utilization.py` to test the worker distribution logic.

3. Monitor the scheduler logs to confirm that all 10 workers are being used and all due ads are being posted.

## Conclusion

The worker utilization issue has been fixed by implementing destination-level worker distribution instead of slot-level assignment. This ensures maximum efficiency and throughput while still respecting anti-ban rules.
